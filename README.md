## Aim:
Aim of this project is to develop a personal assistant system for deaf-blind people to help identify faces of people and objects in terms of Morse code.

## Synopsis:
In the era of artificial intelligence lot of object and face detection devices are available for visually impaired people. When it comes to subject of deaf-blind people there is none of devices available in market. For them, only communication devices like MyVox, Sparsha are available rather than personal assistive devices. In this project we are going to propose a personal assistive device to help deaf-blind people using Machine learning and Morse code.
It consists of multiple in-built options like object detection, facial recognition and communication module. For object detection, we are using Machine learning objection detection model which is trained by CNN algorithm. It can detect multiple objects at same time and detected objects name is intimated to user by tactile vibrations. For face detection, first we are collecting dataset and trained them into CNN model. Using this model we can recognize trained faces and can intimated user when only device in face identification mode. To make communication between users with other people we are using Google speech recognition and text to speech conversion. Every text appeared in the module is converted into Morse code to make corresponding tactile vibrations.
